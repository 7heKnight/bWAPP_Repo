On first look, we found that there was text box. I tried to input `a` value and search it. When user click Go, the client will send to server with following variables: `var movie = a` and `var action = go`.

I tried with Single Quote (`' or %27`) which usually causing the SQL Injection vulnerable. And following picture is what we expected error Message.

And following attack will be the same with [SQL Injection (GET-Search)](SQL%20Injection%20(GET-Search).md)

# 2. Medium
In this case, lab using `mysql_real_escape_string()` function to filter, so could not bypass

In this case, lab using [mysql_real_escape_string()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php) function to filter which is convert `'` to `\'` or other risk character that causing escape string of SQL.

# 3. Script Supported
In this case, SQL Injection Techniques has already have [SQLMap](https://sqlmap.org/) which is a powered tool develop in python so that I should not write a script because of not better than [SQLMap](https://sqlmap.org/) üòÅ
- `sqlmap.py -u http://bee.bug:80/bWAPP/sqli_2.php?movie=1%27&action=go --hostname --tables --users --dbs --passwords --columns --cookie=PHPSESSID=c77d6e1e60e432177d833db76d92d0a9;security_level=0`

We known the credentials in hashes:
```shell
[*] debian-sys-maint [1]:
    password hash: *D4749CBC6F877E93F4A942F787C272224CC91D4A
[*] root [1]:
    password hash: *07BDCCE30E93A12AA2B693FD99990F044614A3E5
```
Trying to use [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) to see if we can have cleartext?

And finally, all reports that output in following path: 
- Environment variable path: `%LocalAppData%\sqlmap\output\<host_name_scanned>`
- Shell folder: `shell:Local AppData\sqlmap\output\<host_name_scanned>`

# 4. Remediation

- Validating User Input and only accept word or number only, example given using regular expression: `\w+` or `[a-zA-Z0-9 .-_]+`
- Using function to filter input: 
	- `$value = mysql_real_escape_string($data);`
	- `$value = addslashes($data);`
- Using [sanitize filter php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.sanitize.php)
